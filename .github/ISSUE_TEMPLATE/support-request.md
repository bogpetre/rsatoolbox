Hi and thanks for using `rsatoolbox`. This category of issues is for when you're unsure how something is supposed to work. We welcome these as it may help us make the library easier to use. However, we are also just scientists doing this on the side, so please bear with us if it takes longer to get back to you.

Where applicable, please tell us a bit about:
- type of data
- experimental design
- what you are trying to accomplish
- what have you tried but didn't work, or if you feel there's something lacking in the documentation

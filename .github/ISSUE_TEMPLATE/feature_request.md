**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you may have considered.

- would you be willing to write code for the library with us?
- if so, what do you need from us to get started?

**Additional context**

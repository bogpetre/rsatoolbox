    "## Riemannian Distances\n",
    "\n",
    "The Riemannian distance is a method for comparing RDMs originally proposed by [Shahbazi et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118271). It is the Riemannian geodesic distance in the space of positive definite matrices. It is a bit more computationally expensive to compute, but performed well as a stable comparison metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main differences to other RDM comparison measures in our toolbox are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To convert into a similarity measure, we take the negative of the Riemannian distance. As a consequence all results are negative and 0 is an absolute upper bound to RDM similarity or model performance. This is normal for this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Computing the Riemannian distance requires an optimization to adjust a mixture of the noise second moment matrix and the second moment matrix according to the other RDM. This results in a relatively high computational effort. \n",

    "### Conversion to second moment matrices\n",
    "To apply Riemannian distances RDMs, we need to transform the RDMs into second moment matrices. To do so, we need to find a linear and one-to-one transformtion from the dissimilarity into the inner product (positive definite second moment) space. When we calculate the RDM from the pattern matrix, we lose the information of the mean pattern. The second moment matrix calculating from the RDM assuming that the origin is zero, has inherently one zero eigenvalue. Therefore the Riemanninan distances calculating between these second moments are equal to infinity. One alternative is to set the activity pattern of one condition to the origin which results to a $(n_{cond}-1)\\times(n_{cond}-1)$ second moment matrix."
